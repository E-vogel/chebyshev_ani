# Chebyshev Linkage Animation

This MATLAB function visualizes and animates a Chebyshev linkage mechanism. It includes real-time simulation and interaction features, such as mouse-based joint adjustments.

## Overview

- Simulates the motion of the linkage.
- Provides interactive controls for adjusting joint positions.
- Displays the trajectory of the moving joints.

## Features

- **Animation**: Visualizes the dynamic movement of the linkage.
- **Interaction**:
  - **Mouse**: Drag joints (`A`, `B`, `C`) to adjust positions.
  - **Keyboard**:
    - `Shift`: Start animation.
- **Visualization**: Plots linkages and trajectories with real-time updates.

## Usage

1. Save the code as `chebyshev_ani.m`.
2. Run the function in MATLAB:

   ```matlab
   chebyshev_ani

## Output
